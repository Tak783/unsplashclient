# Presentation

The app itself. The highest layer, and the only place that knows which platform it is for and
which features it ships.

Contents: the `UnsplashClient` iOS app.

Its job is assembly. It composes the feature UI into a running app and configures anything that is
process wide, such as the image cache. It holds no feature logic and no view components of its
own, because both belong further down where other apps can reuse them.

## Import direction

A package may only import packages from layers below it. Nothing imports upward. This is what
keeps the concerns separate: a lower layer never knows what is built on top of it, so it can be
reused by anything.

```
UnsplashClient (iOS app)                            high level layer, presentation
        │ imports
        ▼
UnsplashPhotosFeatureUI                             feature UI layer
        │ imports
        ▼
UnsplashPhotosFeature                               feature layer, the middle
        │ imports
        ▼
CoreNetworking · CoreSearch · CoreDesignSystem      core layers
        │ imports
        ▼
CoreFoundational                                    low level layer, foundation
```

Worked example. `UnsplashPhotosFeature` may import `CoreFoundational`, `CoreNetworking` and
`CoreSearch`, because all three sit below it. It may not import `UnsplashPhotosFeatureUI`, because
that sits above it. `CoreFoundational` may import nothing from this repository at all.
